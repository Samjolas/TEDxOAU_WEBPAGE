      TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started
      as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to
      support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED
      Conferences invite the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18
      minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at
      TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth
      Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi
      Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman. The annual TED Conference
      takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED’s media
      initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; TED
      Translators, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well
      as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative
      TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious Project that takes a
      collaborative approach to funding ideas with the potential to create
      change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in
      hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the
      TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the
      globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

      TEDx<br />
      <br />
      In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called
      TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people
      together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxOAU,
      where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxOAU event, TED
      Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and
      connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance
      for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are
      self-organized.<br />
      <br />

      TEDxOAU <br />
      <br />
      TEDxOAU is an independently organized TED event under an authorized
      license from TED at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. It is an
      initiative that aims to bring together a socially conscious community in
      OAU and make the youths involved in the spectrum of IDEAS WORTH SPREADING.
      Holding for the second time after a four-year hiatus break, TEDxOAU
      targets an audience of students, young professionals and academic members
      of staff. The conference hopes to shine the spotlight on interdisciplinary
      speakers — including those from the local community — who will ignite
      action, and encourage innovation, and critical discussion. About the Team

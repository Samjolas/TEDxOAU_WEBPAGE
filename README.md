About Us (To be worked on still)

TED
TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world‚Äôs leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman. The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED‚Äôs media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious Project that takes a collaborative approach to funding ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

TEDx
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxOAU, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxOAU event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

TEDxOAU 
TEDxOAU is an independently organized TED event under an authorized license from TED at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. It is an initiative that aims to bring together a socially conscious community in OAU and make the youths involved in the spectrum of IDEAS WORTH SPREADING. Holding for the second time after a four-year hiatus break, TEDxOAU targets an audience of students, young professionals and academic members of staff. The conference hopes to shine the spotlight on interdisciplinary speakers ‚Äî including those from the local community ‚Äî who will ignite action, and encourage innovation, and critical discussion.

About the Team (Completed)

<!-- ===================================================================================================================================================================================== -->


Olufolake Zion

There are a lot of things that I enjoy doing. Creating strategy, thinking on my feet, talking to people, and engaging in intellectual conversations with unlike-minded people.

I'm all for innovation and idea execution, so as a profession, I create strategies for startups & small businesses, manage communities, and drive growth through branding.

Sometimes, I feel I'm not a single person‚Äîmore like an amalgamation of different personalities that came together to make one unique entity. Regardless of every other thing, I believe so much in the power of people and maximizing the potential that lies within everyone. 



Tobiloba Ibraheem

When you meet me for the first time, you‚Äôre immediately going to connect like we‚Äôre old friends. I am a warm and friendly person who loves connecting with people every chance I get. I am also one person who strongly believes in changing the world from his ‚Äòlittle‚Äô space, which is what brought me to TEDxOAU. 

I am a third-year university student who has always had a passion for computers and technology. I hope to use my broad educational background with excellent analytical, technical, and programming skills to thrive as a successful software engineer.


Joy Eze

Dreams and People. I am a firm believer in these two.

For dreams, I believe that everyone can achieve their dreams if they can only be resilient to trust, believe in the process, and prepare daily to achieve them. I may not be great at everything, but here‚Äôs something I know I‚Äôve mastered. It‚Äôs using my imagination to create the life I want and visualizing what it will take to make my dreams a reality.

For people, I see humans as ‚ÄòFlawesome‚Äô Flawed but awesome! For every cause I am a part of, I commit my 100% to the people, just as I do the vision. For me, it‚Äôs not just about achieving my dreams but also helping others achieve theirs ‚Äî one person at a time. After all, the South African saying (Ubuntu) is true: ‚ÄúI am because you are‚Äù.


Olaniyi Popoola

I have been passionate about creativity for as long as I can remember; from writing stories that invoke emotions to creating eye-catching designs, and now, beautiful, fluid 2D animations.

One special thing about me is I see things differently from others and when I do, I am blunt to speak about it. The good news is even when I could be resolute in my ideas and opinions, I am still open-minded to new concepts from others and I don‚Äôt mind a challenge. I can say I bring authenticity to things which is what I feel makes me instrumental to the team.

My vision is to be a part of the generation of incredible creatives doing stellar work and reshaping the narrative of Nigeria and Nigerians into a positive light that shows off our ingenuity, creativity, integrity, and functionality.


Samuel Jolayemi

Real Estate, Technology, and Finance are my major interests.

Ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about creating an impact in the real estate sector. I am also one who is in love with tech and these two fields birthed my interest in PropTech sometime this year.

When I am not editing videos, creating websites, or reading books, I am learning new things, connecting with friends, and digesting resources concerning the improvement of PropTech 4.0. 

My 5-year goal is to be a key ingredient in the PropTech Development in Nigeria whereas making an impact in such sector. 



Ayomide Adekola 

I'm Ayomide, but you can call me Ayopelumi.

I'm a certified project manager with a major interest in managing projects that focus on promoting quality education, human capital development, and community development. I love philosophy, writing, reading, and hanging out with people. 

I'm also a youth development enthusiast and any event or program that has to do with supporting young people in their personal and career development journey sparks my interest. 


Anu Adelaja 

I am Adelaja Anuoluwapo, I am a Corporate Law enthusiast and a social media manager.

Here‚Äôs one thing I firmly believe: No one has to go down for you to rise. Everyone has their journey. The sky is vast enough for all birds to fly.

I love growth, that's why I seek constant and intentional growth. Everything I do revolves around this and I am glad to have the opportunity to impact lives and grow at TEDxOAU. 


Ajala Joy Chinemerem 

I am Chinemerem, the only Chinemerem who is a Yoruba lady with both parents (both from the West) who fell in love with the meaning of a name and decided to give their daughter üòÅ. 

I am a copywriter and an email marketer. I enjoy volunteering, traveling, and engaging in conversations with people virtually (as I will probably be shy to meet them physically). 

During my free time, I chat with friends, connect with more people online or watch YouTube videos. In all, I‚Äôm a wonderful person and would make an incredible friend.


Tolu Oluwadare

Like a gift box, if you don‚Äôt unwrap it, you‚Äôd never know what lies inside. If you don‚Äôt meet me, you‚Äôd never really know. What I share is definitely not all there is.

I enjoy reading articles that cover business, technology, and economics, watching animations, learning and sometimes writing. I like modern architecture, Ren‚Äôs Sneakers, beanies, and wildlife. 

I‚Äôd easily pass for an environmentalist, a data analyst, a project manager, a public policy analyst, a Business Intelligence analyst, a student, or a writer depending on the time and place. But, you can be sure that regardless of the many hats, I am a great friend.



Ife Williams (in progress)

I'm Ife Williams, a Christian, a current student of the English Department, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU). I am in charge of the Production Unit, TEDxOAU. I am from Osun State. I love things and activities that have to do with Media Productions; I want to become cinematographer and a film producer. I have a vision to own a media company. Volunteering is also one of the things I'm passionate about and I have been fortunate to be part of the volunteers and head some media team of various organizations like Hult Prize OAU, MFMCF OAU, 5.0 Student Community, Lead Footprint Africa. I also own a photography brand(ife_williams on IG). I love love traveling and touring, helping others and I'm a preacher of loveüòä.

Tosin Ajetunmobi (in progress)

When you think of me, think of light in a dark room.

I am Tosin. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs really all you need to know. But since you are still reading, I might as well share some more.

I enjoy reading, writing, and connecting with people. 
I love people A LOT. Particularly because there‚Äôs a joy that comes with being able to impact people one after the other. It‚Äôs my why for being a part of TEDxOAU.

When you think of Tosin, think of light in a dark room. You can never get moody around me, you‚Äôll either leave with a smile or feel better than you came. 

Now, I mean it. That‚Äôs really all you need to know. For now.
